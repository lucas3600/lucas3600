- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucas3600
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. I have programmed since I was 12 years old (I am now 19).I am fascinated by machine learning and artificial intelligence. I love also life simulation. But I am curious of everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning engineering. So I don't have too much time to programming. But I try my best to stay first of my school and keep programming. 
- 💞️ I haven't had a lot of opprtunity to collaborate but I would love to help for something or collaborate on every subject to learn from others and to improve my skills. 
- 📫 You can send me a email on adriendupaysdenhaut@gmail.com
 - I have also a blog when I am theorically posting my update of my work : https://leschroniqueseldorado.blogspot.com/
